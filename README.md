# Japanese

This is an ongoing project to assist me in learning Japanese.

Based on the Genki series of textbooks, these exercises will take the
user through basic Japanese.

It is also a guide for me to work through the difficulties of English natural
language processing.

This is very much a work in progress. As such, the directories are complete
spaghetti and are NOT to be considered anywhere near a master work.
